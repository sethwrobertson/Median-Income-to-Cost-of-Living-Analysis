# Median-Income-to-Cost-of-Living-Analysis
In this project, I explored the relationship between median incomes and the cost of living in major US cities. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Numbeo, I calculated income-to-cost-of-living ratios to highlight where salaries stretch the furthest.I gathered data, cleaned the data, matched datasets, and visualized city comparisons using a regression.
